The Hawking Toolbar Project's goal is to design a firefox plugin which will enable users to navigate website links (and other clickable content) using a limited interface. This will allow users with disablilities to interact with a simple interface customized to best suit their abilities.
This project hopes to achieve a plugin with two styles:
  * A basic, limited interface for specialized literacy teaching to disabled people
  * A robust toolbar which will allow interfacing not only with the website, but also the browser history, (back, forward, refresh)
The plugin should not recognize links `<a href>` tags but also form buttons and any object on the page with javascript onClick event capturing. The selection of links should be easily recognizable and customizable to the abilities of the user
