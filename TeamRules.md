### Coding Practices ###
  * Variable names
    * descriptive: medium (name but not too long)
    * comment on variables that aren't obvious (like firefox stuff)
    * humpback style variable + function names

  * Eclipse plugin for Javascript as IDE + Eclipse Subversion Support
    * look at filespace?

  * Commenting
    * javadoc format
    * on function names, descriptions, pre/post conditions where needed
    * bracket {
> > > }
    * @param type name  description for inbound params
  * Refactor ALL USABLE CODE from ground up so we can learn it ourselves (from scratch)
  * subversion may need different documents
  * all code reviewed by all team members (only 2000 current lines)

### Learning ###
  * Firefox Plugins
  * Javascript prototypes, classes, etc. good review
